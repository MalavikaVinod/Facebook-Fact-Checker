I thank Professor Miriam for providing us with this wonderful opportunity to share the skills we learnt through this website, and for her constant support throughout the project. I also want to thank my dear friend, Arunabh Ghosh for his neverending support and determination in helping me figure out Jekyll and its various issues with publishing! Thank you to all my wonderful peers of DH 201 for teaching me something new everyday! </p>
